# rucet
introducing rucet
<br>remember that freenet/hyphanet thing? doesn't even run on mac anymore
### <br>we deserve something *better*
rucet, a decentralized lawless network
<br>where you can distribute *anything*
<br>and there's *nothing* the government can do
<br>who fucking CARES what you do
<br>this is our earth
<br>and it sure aint theirs
